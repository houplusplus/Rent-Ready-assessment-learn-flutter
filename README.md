# Learn flutter in 2 weeks : a first project.

Learning Flutter and Dart in 2 weeks : a First project.
This project was a part of the Rent Ready company technical assessment.
The original requirements were adapted to focus on learning Flutter and Dart.

I recommend anyone wanting to learn flutter to try recreating this task and follow the technical and functional requirements.
**Notes**: 
- I started from scratch with zero knowledge of flutter, dart and any related technology, but with an extensive mobile development experience.
- I spend 3 days learning Dart basics, and 5 days creating the project, including other tasks.
- After finishing this task, you will be qualified as a Junior flutter developer. See **Next Steps** for a roadmap to Senior level.

## Project objective

The goal of this task is to :

* Create a application
* Implement search and filtering capabilities
* Implement a details view
* Read data from a json web service

You will Learn:
- **UI** : Widgets (Stateless, Stateful, Style)
- **Assets** : (Fonts, images, files)
- **Data and Backend** : Local and Remote (Networking with http and dio)
- **State Management**


Note: It was recommended to implement a Web Application in sake of simplicity.

## Technical Requirements
* Search by account name or account number
* Filtering by StateCode and StateOrProvince


## Functional Requirements for Junior level

[x] Implement Dart/Flutter app

[x] Implement preloader for search and filtering

[x] A solution should be in a public repository

[x] Meaningful readme.md in the repository root


## Mockup

The page should contain:
- Search field
- Drop down list with filtering
- Switch: list or cards
- Accounts objects

# Next Steps

## Functional Requirements for Sunior level

[ ] Unit Tests

[ ] UI components tests

[ ] Build scripts should be implemented inside a docker container

[ ] Connect to dataverse storage webservice and make search and filter on server side

## Other things to learn in Flutter

[ ] Animations

[ ] Socket networking

[ ] Internationalization and Accessibility

[ ] Native Integration : Java/ Kotlin and Swift/ Objective-C
